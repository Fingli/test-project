Missing required features
=> Missing license [The theme must clearly indicate GPL or a GPL-compatible license]
=> Missing add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' ) [This should be called in the theme's functions.php file. Present RSS links in header.php should be removed, ATOM is ok]
=> Missing comment_form() 
[Theme must include this hook in comments.php, instead of writting own form. For more details and customization read the description in http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/comment_form ]
Example: 
<?php 
$args = array(
	'comment_field' => '<p class="comment-form-comment"><textarea id="comment" name="comment" cols="45" rows="8" aria-required="true"></textarea></p>',
	'comment_notes_after' => ''
);
comment_form($args); ?>
=> Global content width must be defined in functions.php
 Example: 
if ( ! isset( $content_width ) )
	$content_width = 640; // Should be equal to the width the theme is designed for
=> Custom menu with wp_nav_menu() is a must [replacing wp_list_pages, wp_list_categories, wp_page_menu, etc. as a menubar system]. Read more at http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu
=> Presence of 'include (TEMPLATEPATH . "/searchform.php");' [must be replaced with get_search_form() ]
=> wp_head(); must be immediately before </head> 
=> wp_footer(); must be immediately before </body> in footer.php
=> Missing body_class() inside <body> tag 
Example  
<body <?php body_class(); ?>>
=> Missing post_class() inside <div id="post">
